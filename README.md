the challenge is to build the backend functionality for
a news aggregator website that pulls articles from various sources and serves them to the
frontend application.
Requirements:
1. Data aggregation and storage: Implement a backend system that fetches articles from selected data sources
   (choose at least 3 from the provided list) and stores them locally in a database. Ensure that the data is regularly
   updated from the live data sources.

2. API endpoints: Create API endpoints for the frontend application to interact with the backend. These endpoints
   should allow the frontend to retrieve articles based on search queries, filtering criteria (date, category, source), and
   user preferences (selected sources, categories, authors).
   Data Sources That Can Be Used (Choose At Least 3)

NewsAPI
OpenNews
NewsCred
New York Times
BBC News
